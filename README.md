Tic-Tac-Toe via React 

Overview

This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game. The game also supports detecting a draw when the grid is filled without a winner.
